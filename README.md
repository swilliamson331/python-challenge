- I used the cereal activity 3-01 for the general basis of my code (importing and reading in the csv, skipping the header, then looping through the rows of the csv)
- Referenced other in class activites for simpler datapoint pulls such as total months/votes, total profits/losses, appending a column)
- In PyBank, got the initial setting of increases and decreases to None and using that in the if statements from internet resources
- Used knowledge and trial and error for the if statement layouts for increases and decreases
- For average change, used simpler for loop format professor showed in class, and used statistical knowledge for average calculation
- Looked up online how to export to a text file, and how to have an f-string span multiple rows
- Mostly referenced PyBank in the doing of PyPoll
- Used class learnings of dicts and for votes variable
